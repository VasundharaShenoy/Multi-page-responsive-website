            <h2>The Shawshank Redemption</h2><br>

            <center><i><b>“Get busy living or get busy dying.”</b></i></center><br>
            
            <p>Most of you might be familiar with the above line in spite of not having watched the movie. This line holds a very powerful sentiment. You either get busy making the most of your days to pursue your goals in life or just accept the days as they come by without doing a thing. The Shawshank redemption is a well-scripted movie that is sure to leave you mind-blown by the end it. The movie is based on the novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. It was released in the year 1994 starring Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd Redding (Red) and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne. The movie comes under Drama/Crime genre and has an IMDb rating of 9.3.</p>
            
            
            <p>The movie starts with a bunch of prisoners coming out of a bus. The inmates bet on which of them would breakdown first and Red places his bet on a lanky fellow named Andy Dufresne. Much to his surprise Andy was able to make it through the night without making a fuss due to which Red ends up losing the bet. He starts finding Andy fascinating due to his quiet nature and befriends him. Andy was banker who was wrongfully accused of having killed his wife on finding out about her affair and is sent to Shawshank prison to serve his life sentence. Red is the person on the inside who could get the inmates anything they wanted. During the course of the movie he gets Andy a rock hammer and Rita Hayworth poster as requested. Every 10 years Red is made to face the parole board who asks him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated to which he replies positively but keeps getting denied parole.</p>
            
           
            <p>As the movie moves forward, we see that Andy begins to understand the workings of the prison. His accounting skills come handy as he starts helping the corrupt warden to launder money and helps the prisoners with their taxes. Brooks, the librarian is given parole but he doesn’t want to leave as the walls had grown on him. When he finally leaves, he sees that so many changes had taken place ever since he had been imprisoned and wasn’t able to keep up with them. He writes a letter to his friends back in prison about his difficulties adjusting and later kills himself. This reminds us of what Red had told earlier that at first the inmates hate the walls but as time passes by, they begin to grow on them and get used to it. Helping the warden gave Andy a few perks and a higher status in the prison. He uses this to his advantage and broadens the range of books in the library. Andy says- “The funny thing is, on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook.” We get to see the irony here as Andy was an innocent man while he lived his life outside the walls. It was on the inside that he learned how to be a crook.</p>

            <p>Later a man named Tommy is imprisoned and upon learning the reason for Andy’s imprisonment he claims that he knows who the real killer is. Norton (the warden) fears getting his money laundering exposed if Andy is released and throws him in confinement and gets Tommy killed. Upon releasing Andy from confinement, the warden threatens to close down the library if he doesn’t continue helping him with the laundering. Sometime after, we see Andy telling Red about his dream to go down south and spending his life in Zihuantanejo and tells Red that if he ever gets released to go find for a hayfield in Buxton along with further instructions on what to do. The next day during roll call Andy does not answer and upon checking his cell they find out that he had escaped.  The warden gets furious and throws a stone at the Rita Hayworth poster on Andy’s wall due to which it gets torn and reveals a tunnel that was dug by Andy over the past 20 years with the help of the rock hammer. Andy had escaped with the warden’s bank information and withdraws all the money and sends evidence of the laundering to the newspapers. The warden shoots himself to avoid getting caught. When Red is put in front of the parole board again, he is furious and busts the idea of rehabilitation. Surprisingly this time he is released from the prison.</p>


            <p>In the final act Red is given parole and he starts working at a grocery store. One day he decides to follow the instructions given to him by Andy and finds himself with a good amount of cash and a note telling him to meet at Zihuantanejo. He is then seen travelling to Mexico and happily reuniting with his friend Andy.</p><br>

            <p>This movie beautifully portrays the themes of the human spirit, hope and redemption. During Andy’s 20 years of sentence not once did he give up and managed to overcome all the adversities. Andy was busy living while the rest were too busy dying.</p>
